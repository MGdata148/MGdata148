Hi, I'm Magda! I am passionate about molecular biology and genetics. Through my scientific work, I developed a deep interest in data analysis, as I believe recognizing patterns and uncovering meaningful insights is essential in both science and industry. My goal is to transition from academia to a career in data analytics, leveraging the critical thinking and problem-solving skills I honed during my PhD journey to tackle real-world challenges.

Here, I aim to showcase my learning progress by sharing projects that demonstrate the skills I've recently acquired.
